# _TOLU Pathfinder_

The _TOLU Pathfinder_ app demonstrates the execution of several path finding algorithms on weighted bidirectional graphs. By utilizing an interactive map view, users can create their own graph or have one generated by the app. After selecting a start and end node, the graph traversal algorithms can be activated and while search is in progress, every step of the algorithm is visualized in the map. This allows users to experiment and compare, how different traversal algorithms perform on specific graph characteristics.

## App components

Implemented as a single-page web app, _TOLU Pathfinder_ provides a map view with a collapsible sidebar menu. The following sections take a closer look at all of their subcomponents and how to use them.

### Interactive map

A map view is the core component of the app and allows users to create nodes (markers) and connect them with other nodes automatically or manually. The second option allows users to add edges (connections) between the current and previously selected nodes by selecting the "connect" option in the node's popup. Connections can be removed by clicking on them and selecting the "disconnect" option from the popup that opens up.

In order to run search algorithms on the graph, a start and end node need to be selected which can be achieved by selecting the appropriate option from the nodes popup.

### Graph-builder

To simplify experimenting, a Graph-builder component was implemented which allows to generate either a regular grid or a random graph network. The number of nodes that will be created can be adjusted in the settings menu. Besides that, a setting for the build speed can be found as well.

### Algorithms

The following graph traversal algorithms have been implemented and can be used:

- Breadth-First-Search ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search))
- Depth-First-Search ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search))
- Dijkstra ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm))
- A\* (Manhatten) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm))
- A\* (Euclidean) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm))

### Statistics

A statistics view can be activated on the top-right corner of the map view. It provides information about the number of nodes and edges of the current graph. Besides that, it keeps track of all search algorithms that were executed on the current graph and therefore allows comparisons regarding their performances.

## Developer documentation

### Main programming language and libraries

The project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and as frontend library serves [React](https://reactjs.org/) together with the UI-components of [Ant Design](https://ant.design/). For the realization of the map view, [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) were utilized.

### Setup

Follow the steps below to setup the project on your local machine.

1. Make sure to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

2. Clone the project into your local directory:

   > `git clone https://github.com/Tom-Lutze/tolu-pathfinder.git`

3. Install the required node packages within the project directory:

   > `npm i`

4. Run the app in development mode by executing the start script:

   > `npm start`

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Scripts

The following scripts are available.

Start in development mode:

> `npm start`

Create production build:

> `npm build`

Launch the interactive test runner:

> `npm test`

Eject the project to customize the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject) configuration:<br>
**Note: ONE-WAY operation!**

> `npm eject`

Launch prettier on all files for code formatting:

> `npm prettier-all`

### CRACO for LESS support

In order to integrate Less files in the project compilation process, [CRACO](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject) and [CRACO-Less](https://github.com/DocSpring/craco-less) became part of the project which allow the reconfiguration of [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) without using `eject`. To switch back to the standard [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) configuration, simply uninstall the CRACO packages, remove the `craco.config.js` and replace all occurences of `"craco"` with `"react-scripts"` within the `package.json` scripts-section.
